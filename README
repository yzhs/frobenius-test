This is a implementation of the probabilistic primality test described by Jon
Grantham in "A Probable Prime Test with High Confidence", published in the
"Journal of Number Theory" 72, pages 32--47 (1998).  The algorithm is
implemented in C using the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP).

To a certain degree, it is intended as a benchmark, to see how fast this
algorithm is, relative to the Strong Probable Prime Test (the Miller-Rabin
primality test).
