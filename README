This is an implementation of the probabilistic primality test described by Jon
Grantham in "A Probable Prime Test with High Confidence", published in the
"Journal of Number Theory" 72, pages 32--47 (1998).  The algorithm is
implemented in C using the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP).

In addition to the Quadratic Frobenius test from the above paper, there is
also an implementation of the Mille Rabin primality test for speed comparison.
Both tests are optimized to roughly the same extant (not very much) to provide
a reasonably fair comparison.

There are also implementations of both of these primality tests using machine
words (assuming a 64-bit architecture).  This implementation is significantly
faster for the numbers it can handle.  Therefore, it can be used to test a
large number of integers for compositeness, or checking a large number of the
possible parameters for a given integer.
